# Python-Exploration
This is a repository that contains code that I have written to learn more about python.

Exercises 2,3, and 4 are assignments from the book:
Lerner, R. (2020). Python workout: 50 ten-minute exercises. Manning Publications Co.

They include my own little "twists" on the exercise to help me make sure that I fully understand what is happening.
